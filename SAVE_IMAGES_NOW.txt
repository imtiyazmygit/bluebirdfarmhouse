The website is ready but needs the 8 images you attached.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

     * 1 kitchen (with gas stove)
     * 1 garden with benches
     * 2 swimming pool photos
     * 1 purple room with fridge

2. SAVE EACH IMAGE TO THIS FOLDER:
   C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\2025\CLIENTS\bluebirdfarmhouse\images\

3. USE THESE EXACT FILENAMES:

   bedroom1.jpg          ← Bedroom with blue designer ceiling (1st photo)

   swimming-pool2.jpg    ← Pool different angle (7th photo)

4. HOW TO SAVE:
   - Right-click each image in the chat
   - Choose "Save Image As..."
   - Navigate to the images folder
   - Type the exact filename from above
   - Click Save

5. VERIFY:
   - Open: C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\2025\CLIENTS\bluebirdfarmhouse\images\

2. Copy them to: C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\2025\CLIENTS\bluebirdfarmhouse\images\
3. Rename them using the list in Step 3 above

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
- Make sure filenames are EXACT (lowercase, no spaces)
- Make sure they're .jpg format
- Make sure they're in the 'images' folder
- After saving, refresh the browser (Ctrl + F5)
